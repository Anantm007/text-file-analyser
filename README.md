# text-file-analyser
A very simple API which I developed to analyse text files or chat messages (such as Whatsapp chats which need to be exported as text files), just for fun. It can calculate frequency of a specific word, frequency of a particulaar emoji, total messages exchanged and total number of characters/alphabets exchanged.
